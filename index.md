## About Myself

I am now a 3rd year PhD student of Mathematics in WUSTL. Before I came to St. Louis, MO, I got my Bachelor's degree in Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X6H7R8zmcizPfe3fdEqiCz7x0PqJQlE6/view?usp=sharing).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Research Interests

I am interested in both mathematics and applied subjects. For mathematics, I mainly study noncommutative geometry and sometimes plunge into partial differential equations. For applied subjects, I spend most of my time on machine learning, especially manifold learning. I am also learning data science at present.

## Programming Skills

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AlfredoJwang/hzhuang/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
